## 1. Introduction 
---

Flight price prediction is a challenging and important problem in the travel industry as accurately predicting the price of flights can help travel agencies, airlines and customers make informed decisions about flight bookings.

### 1.1 Problem Statement

The problem statement for flight price prediction is to develop a model that can accurately predict the price of flights for different routes and dates. This is a challenging problem because flight prices are affected by many factors including airline, route, departure time, seasonality and competition.

### 1.2 Goal

The goal is to build a machine learning model that can take these factors into account and accurately predict the price of flights for new routes and dates. This model can be used by travel agencies, airlines and customers to make informed decisions about flight bookings.

### 1.3 Approach

To solve this problem, we have access to flight data including historical prices, flight routes, airline information and other relevant factors. We can then use this data to train and validate machine learning models that can predict flight prices based on the input features to ensure their accuarcy and effectiveness. 

### 1.4 Use case

This problem is an important one for the travel industry and has many real-world applications such as dynamic pricing, demand forecasting and revenue management.
